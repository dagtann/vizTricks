With the help of the animation package it becomes simple to
create animated graphs in R. Each such graph consists of a
sequence of plots that are converted into the requested
output format. This example generates a simple animated gif
file.
```{r}
## --- Preamble --------------------------------------------
rm(list = ls())                               ## start clean
library('animation')
```

Let's generate some data for plotting. It is necessary to
decide on the number of frames first. To keep things
simple this example generates only $10$ frames.

```{r}
# --- 1) Generate some plotting data -----------------------
set.seed(8734)                       ## ensure replicability
noFrames <- 10             ## how many frames wanted in ani?
dta <- data.frame(                          ## data for plot
  x = 1:noFrames, y = runif(noFrames)
)
head(dta)
```

Now for the tricky part. This example uses  __saveGIF()__
from the animation package. This as any other convenience
function from the animation package opens a graphical
device, then generates a sequence of plots, and
finally saves the result in the requested format.[^1] The
sequence of plots should be based on an expression that is
reapplied to each outputted frame. It is best
to write a function for that purpose. The function below
takes our rexample data, creates an empty plot and finally
loops over each row to plot it.

```{r}
frames <- function(data, domain, range, maxFrames) {
  ## data ... the data frame to plot
  ## index ... domain of the function
  ## value ... range of the function
  ## maxFrames ... how many frames are there?
  plot(            ## generate an empty plot with fixed dims
    x = 0, y = 0, xlim = c(1, maxFrames), ylim = c(0, 1),
    type ='n', xlab = 'Domain', ylab = 'Range'
  )
  for(i in 1:nrow(data)) {
    lines(
      x = c(data[i-1, domain], data[i, domain]), 
      y = c(data[i-1, range], data[i, range])
    )
    points(
      x = data[i, domain], y = data[i, range],
      pch = 16, col = 'black'
    )
  }
}
```

If executed by itself the function merely returns the last
plot. In order to get the entire sequence it must be wrapped
into the __saveGif()__ function. By default the graph is
saved into your current working directory.

```{r, results = 'hide'}
saveGIF(
  lapply(1:noFrames, ## listwise apply FUN to elements 1:noFrames
    FUN = function(k) {     ## anonymous function to lapply
    frames(                 ## plotting function from above
      data = dta[1:k, ], domain = 'x', range = 'y',
      maxFrames = noFrames
    ) 
  }
  ),
  movie.name = 'simpleAnimation.gif',
  interval = .3                          ## animation speed
)
```

Here is the result:

 [^1]: Note that __saveGIF()__ requires ImageMagick to be
  installed on your system.
